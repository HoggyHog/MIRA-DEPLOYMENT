What is the current flowing through the circuit?\"\n   - Use a diagram to illustrate the circuit, labeling the battery voltage and resistance.\n   - Ask students to identify what is known (V = 12V, R = 4\u03a9) and what needs to be found (I).\n\n2. **Define the Goals:**\n   - Students will calculate the current using Ohm's Law (I = V/R).\n   - Discuss the implications of their findings in terms of circuit safety and efficiency, emphasizing the importance of understanding current flow in everyday devices.\n\n3. **Explore Possible Strategies:**\n   - Introduce Ohm's Law with a clear, simplified explanation: \"Ohm's Law states that the current (I) flowing through a conductor between two points is directly proportional to the voltage (V) across the two points and inversely proportional to the resistance (R) of the conductor.\"\n   - Provide a flowchart showing the relationship between voltage, current, and resistance.\n   - Encourage students to brainstorm other scenarios where they might need to calculate current, voltage, or resistance, such as in household appliances.\n\n4. **Act on the Strategies:**\n   - Have students perform the calculation:\n     - I = V/R = 12V / 4\u03a9 = 3A.\n   - Ask them to reflect on what this means in a practical context (e.g., is this current safe for typical household wiring? Discuss common household devices that operate at this current level).\n\n5. **Look Back and Evaluate:**\n   - Discuss the results and ask students to verify their calculations.\n   - Pose questions: \"What would happen if the resistance were increased to 6\u03a9? How would that affect the current?\" Use a simple graph to illustrate the inverse relationship between resistance and current.\n\n### Analytical Thinking Exercises\n\n1. **Scenario Analysis:**\n   - Present a circuit with a 9V battery and two resistors in series (3\u03a9 and 6\u03a9). Use a diagram to visualize the circuit.\n   - Ask students to calculate the total resistance, current, and voltage across each resistor. \n   - Follow up with questions: \"How do
